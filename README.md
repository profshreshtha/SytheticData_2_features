Synthetic Data (2 Features) Dataset
Overview
This dataset, SytheticData_2_features.csv, contains a synthetic binary classification dataset with two features and a label. It is primarily designed for testing and benchmarking various machine learning algorithms.

The dataset is small in size with 20 rows of data, making it ideal for quick experimentation and small-scale projects.

File Description
Filename: SytheticData_2_features.csv
Rows: 20
Columns: 3 (Two features + Label)
Data Columns
Feature_1: Continuous numeric data representing the first feature.
Feature_2: Continuous numeric data representing the second feature.
Label: Binary classification target with two classes, typically 0 or 1.
Usage
This dataset can be used to train and test classification algorithms such as:

Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Decision Tree
Neural Networks
Quantum Classifiers such as VQC, QSVC, etc.
It is especially useful for evaluating performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), and AUC-ROC values.
